# Music Shelf
  This is a social-media-esque site that allows you to create albums, add songs and essentially share your music tastes!

  As someone who's held music near and dear to them, I firmly believe music really shows what kind of person you might be interacting with! Thus the idea of social media + music just made sense (no we're not a myspace clone haha).
